## Structures

.cif - CIF
.vasp - VASP POSCAR

symmetrised_original.cif - Initial structure, but with with the origin shifted to align with the pseudosymmetry group.

symmetrised_original_primitive.cif - As above, but in primitive rhombohedral setting. Used in polarization calculation (polarization/step_10; pseudo_cifs/interpolation/POSCAR_10.vasp).

pseudo_10016.cif - returned CIF file from PSEUDO, the pseudosymmetric supergroup. Our non-polar "parent"/reference.

pseudo_primitive.cif - As above, but in primitive rhombohedral setting.

pseudo_primitive_square.vasp - Pseudosymmetric supergroup, modified (manually) to have a square MnBr4 group rather than a hexagonal MnBr6 group.

pseudo_primitive_square_sorted.vasp - As above, with atomic sites reordered using sort_structures.py to match symmetrised_original_primitive.vasp. Used in polarization calculation (polarization/step_0; pseudo_cifs/interpolation/POSCAR_0.vasp).

interpolation/POSCAR_[0-10].vasp - Interpolation from pseudo_primitive_square_sorted.vasp to symmetrised_original_primitive.vasp, using make_interpolation.py.

interpolation/POSCAR_samelen_tet.vasp - Modification of interpolation/POSCAR_10.vasp, where the Mn-Br bond lengths were manually set to be equal without changing the bond angles. Used in polarization/step_11.

interpolation/POSCAR_symmetric_tet.vasp - Modification of interpolation/POSCAR_10.vasp using symmetrise_tetrahedron.py, where full tetrahedral symmetry is restored to MnBr4. Used in polarization/step_12.

## Code

sort_structures.py - Sorts atomic positions to prepare for interpolation.
Creates pseudo_primitive_square_sorted.vasp from pseudo_primitive_square.vasp and symmetrised_original_primitive.vasp.

make_interpolation.py - Generates interpolation/POSCAR_[0-10].vasp, interpolating from pseudo_primitive_square_sorted.vasp to symmetrised_original_primitive.vasp.

interpolation/symmetrise_tetrahedron.py - Symmetrises the MnBr4 tetrahedron in a structure (assuming there is only one), moving the Br4 ions.

## Misc

PSEUDO_output.pdf - full output of PSEUDO for the chosen structure.

other_pseudo_cifs/ - contains all the non-polar PSEUDO results.
Mostly for demonstration purposes.
