Polarization calculation, using structures from pseudo_cifs.

step_10 is the polar structure calculated in 5.magrelax (put into rhombohedral setting).
step_0 is the nonpolar "parent" structure.
step_11 is a modification of our structure, where the MnBr4 tetrahedron has
been artificially symmetrised so the bond along the chain is the same length
as the other bonds. (I didn't correct the bond angles in this one, though. See step_12 for full symmetrisation.)
step_12 is a modification of our structure, where the MnBr4 tetrahedron has been artificially symmetrised to restore full tetrahedral symmetry.

step_4_wrongmag - The original step_4 ended in a low-spin configuration.
This resulted in a kink in the polarization.
step_4 - This step has the net magnetic moment enforced (through NUPDOWN).
This restored smoothness to the polarization.

get_polarization.py - Takes a list of directories containing VASP OUTCAR and POSCAR files, each representing a step in a polarization calculation.
Prints out the polarization, by the modern theory of polarization (as
implemeneted in Pymatgen). Supports full DFT polarization as well as the simplified point-charge model using formal charges.

polarization - output of get_polarization.py for standard DFT polarization.
It is plotted in polarization_branch.png.

polarization_formal - standard point-charge model polarization.

polarization_samelen_tet, polarization_formal_samelen_tet - polarization with step_11 as the end-point.

polarization_symmetric_tet, polarization_formal_symmetric_tet - polarization with step_12 as the end-point.
